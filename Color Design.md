# Color Design

## Color Wheel and HSLA

HSLA is preferred for design because you can intuitively adjust values (i.e. if it needs to be brighter).



*Hue:* the "pure" color, expressed as the angle in degrees around the color wheel

*Saturation:* the intensity or purity of that hue; 100% saturation is the color itself, while 0% saturation is completely grayscale

*Lightness:* the lightness of the color; 0% is black, 100% is white

*Alpha:* the opacity; 0% is fully transparent, 100% is fully opaque

## Warm Colors

* range between red and yellow; includes orange, brown, and tan
* warmth, aggression, bold

## Cool Colors

* range between blue, purple, and green; includes most grays
* calming, soothing, winter, water

## Tints and Shades

Tints occur when white is added to a color, increasing the lightness of a hue. Shades occur when black is added to a color, decreasing the lightness of a hue.

## Color Contrast

Colors opposite on the color wheel have a higher contrast. Colors next to each other have a lower contrast to one another.

## Monochromatic

Monochrome designs utilize a single color with varying shades and tints to create a palette.

*Page hero* refers to the banner (image, often paired with text and a background) that is placed front and center on the page.

## Complementary

Complementary colors are opposites on the color wheel.

## Analogous

Analogous colors are three or more adjacent colors on the color wheel. Typically, there's one dominant color, combined with a second to support and a third to accent the palette.

## Triadic

Triadic colors are three colors equidistant from each other on the color wheel (e.g. blue, red-orange, yellow-green).

## Color Psychology

- **Red:** Passionate, energetic, angry
- **Orange:** Optimistic, playful, fun
- **Yellow:** Welcoming, intellectual, impatient
- **Green:** Prosperous, balanced, growing
- **Blue:** Peaceful, loyal, cold
- **Purple:** Imaginative, royal, spiritual
- **Gray:** Unemotional, compromising
- **White:** Innocent, pure
- **Black:** Luxurious, powerful

# Color for UI

## Contrast Constraints

Limit the overall amount of contrast to highlight only the most important parts of the page: the actions you want the users to focus on and take. Having a neutral background (any color with low lightness or saturation) is a good base, because it allows you to add high contrast to the parts of the site where you want to direct a user's attention. Similarly, a dark background with light colored text can be reasonable.

## Brand Color

It's essential to select and apply a brand color, a hue that should dominate your color palette and account for roughly 60% of the color used on your site.

## Accent Colors

Accent colors are supplementary hues that provide small pops of color to draw the user's attention.

## Semantic Colors

Provide additional indications to the user when something goes right or wrong. Red is used to show errors or emphasize delete buttons. Green is used to show success or emphasize submitting or moving forward. If something goes wrong on the website that isn't the user's fault, yellow is used.

## Whitespace

Whitespace refers to the emptiness between elements and isn't necessarily white in color.

## Accessibility

*Red-green colorblindness* means users have difficulty differentiating red and green. *Blue-yellow colorblindness* means users tend to see blues as greener. *Monochromatic colorblindness* is where users can't see any color.
