# Days 26 - 30

## Day 26, July 5, 2020

**Python:** I did all the lessons on graphs and asymptotic notation. I began learning about recursion in Python.

**Color Design:** I decided to take a break from really "coding" and do Codecademy's course on color design. I only have access to pro features through July 24, so I figure I should get as much out of it as I can.

## Day 27, July 6, 2020

**Color Design:** I finished this course. It was pretty useful. I understand using colors in web design a bit better now.

**Python:** I started Codecademy's course on statistics in Python and did more recursion exercises.

## Day 28, July 7, 2020

**Python:** finished the recursion exercises. Started learning data analysis with Pandas.

## Day 29, July 8, 2020

## Day 30, July 9, 2020

Finished the file exercises, thus finishing the Python 3 course!
