# Python

## Comments
Python comments begin with `#`. Python does not have multi-line comments.

## Print
Python's version of `console.log()` is `print()`.
```py
print ("I'm Erica")
# I'm Erica
```

## Variables
Variables in Python don't have types like `let` and `const`. Variables don't need to be declared.
```py
meal = "An english muffin"
```

## Errors

### SyntaxError
`SyntaxError` means there's something wrong with the way your program is written: punctuation that doesn't belong, command where it's not expected, missing parenthesis, etc.

### NameError
`NameError` means Python saw a word it doesn't recognize. Code that contains something that looks like a variable that was never defined throws this error.

```py
print(8 ** 2)

```
